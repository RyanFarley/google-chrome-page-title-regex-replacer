* About this extension:
Sometimes you find that you have lots of tabs in one Chrome window. If many of the tabs are titled like "Title Prefix | Meaningful Page Title", you may find that the Meaningful Page Title is completely invisible: http://i49.tinypic.com/e878zd.png

This Chrome extension allows you to specify regex replacements for page titles, so that your tab situation is improved as so: http://i46.tinypic.com/xd9m42.png
